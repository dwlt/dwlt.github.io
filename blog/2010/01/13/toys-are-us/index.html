<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://garypenn.tumblr.com/post/332422329/toys-are-us">garypenn</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>(CREATION Magazine Column, 2000)</em></p>

<p>TOY ARE FOR KIDS – all the best dictionaries say so. What grown person in
their right mind playacts with dolls? Or plays at war with little toy
soldiers? Or with mock weapons, pretending to exchange fire with other grown
people?</p>

<p>More and more grown people every day, it would seem…</p>

<p>Since an industry was founded on the exploitation of virtual space for
interactive entertainment many aliases have been assumed in a search for
identity and mass-market acceptance. ‘TV Games’ became ‘Computer And Video
Games’ became the misnomer ‘Interactive Entertainment’… a term that is equally
valid to describe conversation or sex or a multitude of other acts involving
people or animals.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is the multibillion-dollar industry in question is
dedicated to the next generation of toys, built not from bone, hair, cloth,
wood, metal or plastic but an infinitely flexible digital material.</p>

<p>Now the toys exist in virtual space – the ethereal made almost real for
people either lacking the imagination to make their own contact or curious to
experience first-hand the imagination of others.</p>

<p>Computer technology acts as a receiver and transmitter between the ethereal
and real. Through a simple physical interface (a mouse, control pad or
keyboard perhaps) the user’s input directly or indirectly manipulates an
illusion: a pretend toy set that almost exists &ndash; in virtual space.</p>

<p>This new generation of remote control toys has led to more widespread
neoteny – the retention of juvenile traits &ndash; than ever before. More adults
(primarily males) are prepared to playact with dolls (action figures then),
play at war, race model vehicles and embrace fantasy environments without fear
of stigma.</p>

<p>Perhaps because of the novelty of the technology it’s considered more
socially acceptable to play with virtual toys than real or pretend ones. (It’s
funny how people prepared to kill and be killed in <em>Quake III</em> &ndash; the latest
embodiment of Cowboys And Indians &ndash; wouldn’t be seen dead playing the same
game for real, like kids, with pretend weapons.)</p>

<p>Perhaps we should consider expanding our definition of ‘toy’ – of what a toy
means and who uses it. Toys are the tools of the playful. No other
discrimination is necessary.</p>

<p>There’s no longer a need for vivid imaginations to access and manipulate
ethereal space; no longer a need to make up or set up or tidy up the toy set;
no longer a need to make up objectives or fight over who was hit, who was out,
who is ‘it’, who is right and who is wrong. The playthings, playfields, roles
and rules are more vividly realised. Artificial overseers, opponents and
players ready to assume the most banal of roles are readily available.</p>

<p>Traditional toys come complete with distinct, suggestive themes and outline
stories but seldom ‘supernatural’ rules – focused ways to play with the toys:
defined means of manipulating the toys and definite goals.</p>

<p>Children playing with their toys extrapolate the given theme and suggested
rules to make their own entertainment, re-enacting embellished mundane
situations and events from existing stories.</p>

<p>The industries devoted to the design, development, manufacture and
exploitation of traditional toys focus on realising the basic pieces of the
desired universe because they can leave the player to decide how to use the
toys within physical constraints.</p>

<p>Virtual toy sets on the other hand must be far more elaborate than the more
traditional constructions. The repertoire must be realistic to the extent of
incorporating sufficient natural rules (for example, a consideration of
fundamental physical laws) to ensure that the toy set functions correctly and
conceivable outcomes are satisfied.</p>

<p>Only then can considered supernatural rules be employed to give the player
something to do – some appropriate tasks and challenges and dramatic
situations to exploit the nature of the toy set and its inherent rules.</p>

<p>The action figures (or dolls) still come in all familiar shapes and sizes
and roles &ndash; from stout, squat, moustachioed plumbers (Mario) to Lara Croft:
the new Barbie and Action Man rolled into one (with undertones of a sex doll
thrown in for good measure – and marketing)… Only now these dolls are more
conveniently manipulated and come with more exciting poses and noises &ndash; not to
mention a complete range of accessories, accompanying characters and whole
prefabricated worlds and stories to play with.</p>

<p>Now we have more dramatic reproductions of sports comprising detailed
representations of our leading heroes &ndash; the Subbuteo ‘kick flick’ replaced by
remote control pad buttons to perform much more satisfying football moves.</p>

<p>We have the latest F-1 cars, sports cars, tanks and fighter planes rendered
in glorious digital forms far more desirable than the traditional plastic or
die-cast metal vehicles of old. Small soldiers are no longer frozen in plastic
postures &ndash; they now appear to live to obey our every order without question.</p>

<p>We have the power to ‘magically’ manipulate blocks and bubbles and balloons.
We have expansive arsenals to put even the latest American military technology
to shame and can put the extreme firepower to task in purpose-built arena,
with cameras inside the action figures’ heads for a unique first-person
perspective of alternatives to Cops And Robbers, Cowboys And Indians, War With
Sticks For Guns…</p>

<p>Thanks to the digital medium we have all existing physical toys represented
with more functionality, more convenience, more flourish… and less demands on
imagination.</p>

<p>A future of innovation awaits outside the industry as it stands. People
presently exploiting alternative media will grow increasingly familiar with
interactive space and bring with them an experience of generating content, a
new perspective to create more diverse and captivating situations &ndash; and
perhaps even some new toys.</p></blockquote>
