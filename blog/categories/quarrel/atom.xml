    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally. A full year, four months and three weeks since <a href="http://www.denki.co.uk/2010/04/05/black-easter-monday-at-denki-towers/">Black Easter Monday</a>, <a href="http://www.quarrelgame.com/"><em>Quarrel</em></a> has seen the light of day,
and you can now actually <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/quarrel-deluxe/id453203047?mt=8">buy it for iPhone and iPad</a> (Xbox
next, with other platforms to follow, I believe). You should do that now.</p>

<p>The first time I saw <em>Quarrel</em> was almost exactly three years ago today. I was
in the process of leaving <a href="http://www.slam-games.com">Slam</a>, and I really
wasn&rsquo;t sure what I wanted to do next. I paid a visit to
<a href="http://www.denki.co.uk/">Denki</a> to see what they were up to, since I hadn&rsquo;t
been for a while. Colin and Gary showed me a few of the pilot games they had
(just about) secured funding for, one of which was of course <em>Quarrel</em>. Every
single one blew me away, and I knew I needed to be working with them.
Thankfully for me, they agreed.</p>

<p>Things clearly didn&rsquo;t pan out exactly as we planned three years ago, but
<em>Quarrel</em> is a game that I&rsquo;m incredibly proud to have played a tiny part in
the creation of. The fact that I still love to play the game after being
involved with it for that length of time should say something about it&rsquo;s
quality and longevity. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I do.</p>
