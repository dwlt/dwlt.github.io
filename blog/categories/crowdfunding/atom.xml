    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, the crowdfunding site that can&rsquo;t
handle non-US projects, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/10000-successful-projects">posted some stats</a> from its
first 10,000 funded projects:</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/datas/1621/successful_projects_by_category.large.jpg?1311042509" alt="" /></p>

<p>Music and Film clearly dominate, taking 61.5% of all projects between them,
but Games are way down at the other end of the scale, with just 180 projects:
1.8%.</p>

<p>Why? There&rsquo;s an <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/igda">IGDA selected project</a> page,
after all. <del>I&rsquo;ve asked <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">IndieGoGo</a> (which does
handle non-US projects) how games figured into their stats, and I&rsquo;m waiting
for them to get back to me. I&rsquo;ll update this post as and when they do
so.</del> <strong>Update:</strong> IndieGoGo will only say that games are a &ldquo;steadily
increasing percentage&rdquo; of their 30,000+ campaigns. That makes me think it&rsquo;s a
low percentage.</p>

<p>Are games creators deliberately avoiding this funding model? If so, why?
Especially given that &ldquo;lack of funding&rdquo; is one of the main reasons given for
not making something. Do they think they won&rsquo;t raise enough money? You might
not raise enough to make a big console game, but
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1019019367/urbanized-a-documentary-film-by-gary-hustwit"><em>Urbanized</em></a> (a documentary sequel to <em>Helvetica</em> and
<em>Objectified</em>) raised $118,505. Are players not interested in supporting game
makers? Do players even know who the game makers are? Are the rewards offered
by games projects powerful enough?</p>

<p>Are game makers trying but failing? I follow a fair few people on Twitter from
across film, games, music and theatre. I see lots of project promotion from
all those sectors except games, which leads me to suspect that game makers
aren&rsquo;t even trying it out.</p>

<p>Clearly, I have more questions than answers about this, but given the fuss
about this funding model in the worlds of film, music and art, I&rsquo;m curious as
to why more don&rsquo;t seem to have taken this route.</p>
