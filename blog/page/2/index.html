  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this world of &ldquo;multiplayer games as a service&rdquo;, I see lots of chat about the power of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effects</a> but little about switching costs. Investopedia <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/switchingcosts.asp">defines switching costs</a> as so:</p>

<blockquote><p>The negative costs that a consumer incurs as a result of changing suppliers, brands or products. Although most prevalent switching costs are monetary in nature, there are also psychological, effort- and time-based switching costs.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s a cost (usually non-monetary) involved in switching from one game with friends to another game of the same type with friends. In fact, this cost rockets when your new game is of the same type &ndash; I don&rsquo;t mean just in the same genre, but of games where the differences are not immediately apparent. The problem with the adage &ldquo;never judge a book by its cover&rdquo; is that people inevitably do judge things from a quick glance. So if your game looks quite a lot like <em>Scrabble</em> or Hangman, for example, then people will assume that it is quite a lot like <em>Scrabble</em> or Hangman, and stick with the game they already have that looks quite a lot like (or possibly is) <em>Scrabble</em> or Hangman.</p>

<p>Even if you can get a few people to check your game out, you&rsquo;re then likely to suffer from the downside of network effects. Normally, network effects, where a service becomes more valuable the more people use it, are viewed as a positive. The downside of attempting to build something that relies on this, however, is that if there&rsquo;s no one there to play against, no one will hang around waiting for others to show up. That clearly poses problems in building momentum for your game.</p>

<p>None of which is to say your game can&rsquo;t make that breakthrough against a well-established competitor, but it&rsquo;s going to have to work incredibly hard (and might take a long time) to do so.</p>

<blockquote><p>So who’s right then: Gamers like myself? Or the Games Industry?  Well, Wednesday January 25th 2012 is “The Day Of Reckoning”.  It’s Gamers vs The Games Industry, and one of us is definitely wrong.</p><footer><strong>http://www.denki.co.uk/2012/01/25/quarrel-vs-the-games-industry-whos-right/ Quarrel vs The Games Industry: Who’s Right?</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>It’s true. I remember all the discussions had regarding the received wisdom that “word games don’t sell”.</p>

<p>No, badly made word games don’t sell.</p>

<p>Anyway, I for one welcome our new <a href="http://www.quarrelgame.com/">word game overlord</a>, and so should you. Buy it now, whether or not you have an Xbox. Either way, you won’t regret it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>GamesIndustry.biz <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-09-15-gamecity-launches-turner-prize-of-industry-awards">reports</a> that
<a href="http://www.gamecity.org">GameCity</a> &ldquo;have launched the <a href="http://prize.gamecity.org">GameCity Prize</a>, which it hopes will be the &#8220;Turner / Booker
/ Mercury Prize&rdquo; of the industry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brilliant &ndash; I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://scottishgames.net/2011/03/16/bafta-video-games-awards-the-missing-category/">argued before</a> that we need prizes to celebrate the
best of British talent. That&rsquo;s what the Turner (best British visual artist
under the age of 50) and Mercury (best album from the UK and Ireland) prizes
are about, and the Booker prize is for Commonwealth authors writing in
English. The jury for the prize is fantastic, and the announcement comes with
the following comment from Iain Simons, the brains behind GameCity:</p>

<blockquote><p>The GameCity Prize is about videogames gaining cultural confidence and
expressing their value in something other than financial terms. If games are
worth almost £3 billion a year in the UK &ndash; then surely they&rsquo;re worth thinking
about too.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, absolutely! Let&rsquo;s make a fuss and show off the best of what&rsquo;s made in the
UK! Let&rsquo;s show that we&rsquo;re not just about <em>GTA</em>.</p>

<p>Except. Except except except. The finalists announced for the GameCity prize
are from the following countries: Norway, Denmark, USA, Japan (twice), Canada
and Sweden. All worthy games, no doubt, and they&rsquo;ll all win countless awards
from other places. But they&rsquo;ll all win countless awards from other places.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tiga.org/">TIGA</a> and <a href="http://ukie.info/">UKIE</a> spend all their
time talking up the UK industry to anyone and everyone who will listen, and
yet neither BAFTA nor GameCity (arguably the only other UK organisation that
could give such a prize the credibility and platform it requires) are taking
the opportunity to celebrate the industry.</p>

<p>Or is our industry not as good as we claim?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally. A full year, four months and three weeks since <a href="http://www.denki.co.uk/2010/04/05/black-easter-monday-at-denki-towers/">Black Easter Monday</a>, <a href="http://www.quarrelgame.com/"><em>Quarrel</em></a> has seen the light of day,
and you can now actually <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/quarrel-deluxe/id453203047?mt=8">buy it for iPhone and iPad</a> (Xbox
next, with other platforms to follow, I believe). You should do that now.</p>

<p>The first time I saw <em>Quarrel</em> was almost exactly three years ago today. I was
in the process of leaving <a href="http://www.slam-games.com">Slam</a>, and I really
wasn&rsquo;t sure what I wanted to do next. I paid a visit to
<a href="http://www.denki.co.uk/">Denki</a> to see what they were up to, since I hadn&rsquo;t
been for a while. Colin and Gary showed me a few of the pilot games they had
(just about) secured funding for, one of which was of course <em>Quarrel</em>. Every
single one blew me away, and I knew I needed to be working with them.
Thankfully for me, they agreed.</p>

<p>Things clearly didn&rsquo;t pan out exactly as we planned three years ago, but
<em>Quarrel</em> is a game that I&rsquo;m incredibly proud to have played a tiny part in
the creation of. The fact that I still love to play the game after being
involved with it for that length of time should say something about it&rsquo;s
quality and longevity. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was a bit of a stramash last week regarding who <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-08-11-indies-need-to-give-up-ip-to-get-funding-rebelplay">gets to own the Intellectual Property</a> (registration required)
rights to games when someone other than the creator is paying for it. Good way
to get publicity for a new publisher, some might say.</p>

<p>As you might expect, there was a mix of outrage, agreement, indifference and
factual error in the comments that followed the article. Given that the most
common question I&rsquo;m asked in my role at the <a href="http://www.culturalenterprise.co.uk/">Cultural Enterprise Office</a> is &ldquo;Where can I get money?&rdquo;,
there were a surprising number of people prepared to turn down the chance to
get their product made.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a truism thrown around that game creators must maintain control over
their IP at all costs. It&rsquo;s certainly true that the only way you can build a
sustainable games company is to retain as many rights to as many things as
possible, but you also need a plan that actively builds that value. Simply
making a game and releasing it will technically provide you with some IP, but
if no one knows it exists is it actually valuable?</p>

<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s worth sacrificing IP to reach your ultimate destination. Pixar
never owned the IP in <em>Toy Story</em>. It was all transferred to Disney in the
funding deal for the film. Pixar did retain several royalty streams as part of
the deal (including merchandise, which for some reason no one at Disney
thought would be a big deal in a movie about toys), but Disney had full
control over when or if a sequel would happen, for example. The clue that
there was a masterplan at work is the clause that stated Pixar&rsquo;s logo would be
given equal prominence to the Disney logo in all promotional materials.</p>

<p>When Pixar filed to go public (their IPO date was the week after <em>Toy Story</em>
was due to open), they explicitly stated they wanted to build the next big
consumer facing movie brand of note. A brand that acted as a stamp of quality
and expectation in the same way as Disney, for example (the only other
example). I&rsquo;d say they certainly managed to achieve that, given that more than
five years after Disney acquired them, the name &ldquo;Pixar&rdquo; lives on above the
film name.</p>

<p>Not owning the IP to <em>Toy Story</em> didn&rsquo;t hold Pixar back, but they had a clear
understanding of why it didn&rsquo;t matter quite so much at that point. So, by all
means negotiate to keep your IP, but make sure you have a clear understanding
of what you&rsquo;re negotiating for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, the crowdfunding site that can&rsquo;t
handle non-US projects, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/10000-successful-projects">posted some stats</a> from its
first 10,000 funded projects:</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/datas/1621/successful_projects_by_category.large.jpg?1311042509" alt="" /></p>

<p>Music and Film clearly dominate, taking 61.5% of all projects between them,
but Games are way down at the other end of the scale, with just 180 projects:
1.8%.</p>

<p>Why? There&rsquo;s an <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/igda">IGDA selected project</a> page,
after all. <del>I&rsquo;ve asked <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">IndieGoGo</a> (which does
handle non-US projects) how games figured into their stats, and I&rsquo;m waiting
for them to get back to me. I&rsquo;ll update this post as and when they do
so.</del> <strong>Update:</strong> IndieGoGo will only say that games are a &ldquo;steadily
increasing percentage&rdquo; of their 30,000+ campaigns. That makes me think it&rsquo;s a
low percentage.</p>

<p>Are games creators deliberately avoiding this funding model? If so, why?
Especially given that &ldquo;lack of funding&rdquo; is one of the main reasons given for
not making something. Do they think they won&rsquo;t raise enough money? You might
not raise enough to make a big console game, but
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1019019367/urbanized-a-documentary-film-by-gary-hustwit"><em>Urbanized</em></a> (a documentary sequel to <em>Helvetica</em> and
<em>Objectified</em>) raised $118,505. Are players not interested in supporting game
makers? Do players even know who the game makers are? Are the rewards offered
by games projects powerful enough?</p>

<p>Are game makers trying but failing? I follow a fair few people on Twitter from
across film, games, music and theatre. I see lots of project promotion from
all those sectors except games, which leads me to suspect that game makers
aren&rsquo;t even trying it out.</p>

<p>Clearly, I have more questions than answers about this, but given the fuss
about this funding model in the worlds of film, music and art, I&rsquo;m curious as
to why more don&rsquo;t seem to have taken this route.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/">Letters of Note</a> is a site that collects
&ldquo;fascinating letters, postcards, telegrams, faxes, and memos.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a
<a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/06/pixar-films-dont-get-finished-they-just.html">letter</a> from Pixar director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230032/">Pete Docter</a> (<em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, <em>Up</em>) originally posted last summer, but which I&rsquo;ve seen doing the rounds again recently.</p>

<p>Mostly, people are picking up the closing line: <em>&ldquo;As John Lasseter likes to
say, our films don&rsquo;t get finished, they just get released&rdquo;</em> &ndash; a common refrain
from artists &ndash; but it&rsquo;s an earlier line that jumps out at me:</p>

<blockquote><p>It takes a lot of work (and rework, and rework and rework) to get it right.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ken Levine, of <em>Bioshock</em> fame, on <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-07-07-levine-we-need-to-be-on-the-daily-show">raising industry profile</a> (free registration required):</p>

<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not their fault. It&rsquo;s our fault. As an industry we need to think of
ourselves differently. We need to think of ourselves that way and present
ourselves that way… We have a responsibility … to educate people who don&rsquo;t
think of games. Like the people booking those [chat] shows.</p></blockquote>

<p>His point is that the games industry as a whole, isn&rsquo;t that great at raising
it&rsquo;s own profile, or the profile of those who work within it. Unless, of
course, it&rsquo;s some sort of &ldquo;video nasty&rdquo; type story (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(series)"><em>Manhunt</em></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Coffee_mod"><em>Hot Coffee</em></a>).</p>

<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about over the last week or so, triggered
by a couple of shows on BBC Scotland&rsquo;s Artworks Scotland strand. The
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0100q6v">first</a> was about Scottish bands
heading out to SXSW earlier this year. The
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012c5n2">second</a> about Scotland&rsquo;s comic book
writers and artists. Why isn&rsquo;t there a third show about Scotland&rsquo;s games
industry?</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I&rsquo;ve seen and heard plenty of evidence over the last couple of
years that school pupils and university students don&rsquo;t have a huge awareness
of where games are made in the UK, what games are made in the UK, and the fact
that there&rsquo;s an industry beyond EA, Activision, UbiSoft, Sony, Nintendo,
Microsoft or Take 2. Combine this with <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38072/LA-Noire-studio-accused-of-thankless-crunch-work">quality of life</a> and
<a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38193/Lack-of-female-devs-a-cultural-issue">workplace diversity</a> issues (never mind the <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6295/capturing_the_spirit_of_sesame_.php">lack of creative diversity</a>),
and we have ourselves a bit of an image problem. And it&rsquo;s no use talking to
ourselves about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tiga.org/">TIGA</a> have done a fantastic job of raising awareness of
the industry at a government level, and are rightly applauded for that. But I
agree with Levine&rsquo;s sentiments: it&rsquo;s up to the creators of games to get out
there and talk to the world, rather than just to ourselves. We can&rsquo;t (and
shouldn&rsquo;t) rely on a trade association to do that, we can&rsquo;t (and shouldn&rsquo;t)
rely on the media to come to us. If we don&rsquo;t talk to the world about what we
do, we have no right to complain about being misrepresented or misunderstood.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Develop <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38177/Tax-breaks-will-launch-Australia-into-the-top-3">reports</a> on Australia&rsquo;s tax relief scheme:</p>

<blockquote><p>That breakthrough scheme sets aside $1.9 billion for digital creative
companies across the country.</p></blockquote>

<p>Good for Australia, except… well, it&rsquo;s not a tax credit for &ldquo;digital creative
companies&rdquo; at all (and it&rsquo;s also not $1.9 billion). It&rsquo;s a pure R&amp;D tax
credit, according to the Australian&rsquo;s <a href="http://minister.innovation.gov.au/Carr/MediaReleases/Pages/CROSSBENCHSUPPORTMEANSNEWRDTAXCREDITWILLSTARTON1JULY.aspx">Innovation Ministry</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Gillard Labor Government’s $1.8 billion R&amp;D Tax Credit will deliver more
funding to innovative firms – including manufacturers, ICT and biotech.</p></blockquote>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, this scheme for Australia sounds almost identical to the
scheme we already have here in the UK. It&rsquo;s not just some magical pot of gold
that pours money into the bank accounts of games companies (or indeed, any
company). That&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;credit&rdquo; part in the names of these schemes means.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony Reed, CEO of the Game Developers Association of Australia,
says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our goal at the GDAA is to prepare Australia to become one of the top three
territories in the world for game development within the next five years. I
think this can be achieved.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure he does. I believe that the UK can achieve the same. What I don&rsquo;t
believe is that a tax credit scheme, however designed, is the singular basis
on which that achievement will be made.</p>

<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/06/22/popcap-sale-1-billion/">coverage</a>). I was
looking forward to PopCap going public, for a couple of reasons. First, I was
curious to see the inner workings of the company opened. Secondly, I think it
would have been a great thing for the industry in general to step eating its
own young and have a potentially hugely-powerful new pillar besides the usual
suspects.</p>

<p>Both pieces linked above have some weird bits of reporting, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>TechCrunch implies that PopCap is a &ldquo;hot gaming startup&rdquo; &ndash; whilst two paragraphs later noting that the company was founded in 2000.</li>
<li>TechCrunch claims that it would be a big deal for EA, clearly forgetting that they <a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6140935/electronic-arts-buys-jamdat">paid $680mn for Jamdat</a> in 2005.</li>
<li>VentureBeat states &ldquo;EA already tried buying a social gaming company&rdquo;. Sigh. A) PopCap games are available on every platform you can think of; B) Given that PopCap are the number 3 games company on Facebook (behind Zynga, and yes, EA) according to the same report, this puts EA into a comfortable second place.</li>
<li>A later report from TechCrunch says this deal is a &ldquo;Hail Mary pass from EA to break into mobile and social gaming&rdquo;. Umm. But they&rsquo;re #2 in social, apparently, and made $242mn from mobile in FY2011, a solid 29% of their overall revenue.</li>
</ul>


<p>EA have gone on the record as saying they&rsquo;re reinventing their business as
fast as they can to take advantage of the opportunities available in digital.
PopCap built their business in digital, and have <a href="http://blog.dwlt.net/post/5768044225/popcaps-hidden-gems">a great track record of introducing successful new titles</a>.</p>

<p>EA&rsquo;s interest in PopCap is nothing to do with getting into markets they&rsquo;re
already doing quite well in. EA&rsquo;s interest is centred around PopCap&rsquo;s ability
to continually introduce new games and to make money from them. That&rsquo;s why
they bought Chillingo rather than Rovio. The fact that PopCap have also making
interesting deals in Asia can&rsquo;t have gone unnoticed either.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also some consternation over the price, and I&rsquo;ve seen various people
saying it&rsquo;s a sign of a bubble. My take is that $1bn is basically the minimum
price required to stop PopCap going public &ndash; anything less wouldn&rsquo;t be worth
their while. Given how well they manage to grow their revenue and take
advantage of new platforms, I think it may actually be a relatively cheap deal
in the long-term. PopCap may also be thinking that the impending Groupon IPO
will actually screw up their opportunity, given all the concerns about
Groupon&rsquo;s ability to actually turn a profit.</p>

<p>From EA&rsquo;s point of view, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a great deal. I&rsquo;d (clearly) prefer that
PopCap stayed independent. PopCap themselves provided an unofficial
politician-esque response saying that &ldquo;the company was not planning to sell to
any other company for $1 billion&rdquo; &ndash; so they might be selling for a different
price, then. We shall see.</p>
