  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>[This has been sitting in draft for a while. I thought I&rsquo;d post it in advance
of the budget this week.]</em></p>

<p>Way back in June 2010, the government decided to axe the proposal made by the
previous administration to provide the games industry with some sort of tax
break, saying that the proposal was &ldquo;<a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/osborne-cancels-uk-videogame-tax-relief">poorly targeted</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>On the back of that, industry reaction was along the lines of &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s really
well targeted, look it says specifically &lsquo;games&rsquo; on it&rdquo;. However, it strikes
me that &ldquo;poorly targeted&rdquo; actually means &ldquo;too narrowly targeted&rdquo;. Ontario&rsquo;s
much vaunted games tax relief isn&rsquo;t games tax relief at all; it&rsquo;s actually
digital media tax relief. This gets around the &ldquo;what is a game?&rdquo; problem by
allowing anything digital and interactive to qualify.</p>

<p>The other aspect of Ontario&rsquo;s tax relief scheme that I never see mentioned in
the UK debate is the fact that a company only qualifies for the scheme if they
spend over CA$1 million per year on employment costs. That equates to around
£625,000 in real money. If we assume that an average development company
spends around £5,000 per month per employee (and that any system in the UK
imposed an equivalent threshold), a company needs to employ a minimum of 10
staff. Given the transition of the industry towards smaller, one-project
companies, how many in the UK would actually qualify?</p>

<p>In any case, I think the call for tax breaks won&rsquo;t succeed this time around,
or at any time during this administration. For one, the Tory party really
don&rsquo;t like to target any one specific industry over any other. For another,
there&rsquo;s the administration cost to consider &ndash; any such scheme would introduce
more bureaucracy and paperwork at a time when David Cameron is ranting against
such things in a speech to his party. Ideologically, there&rsquo;s a belief that the
best route to economic growth is to enhance the fundamentals for every
business and industry, not just the select few.</p>

<p>TIGA&rsquo;s recent call to <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-03-10-mp-backs-tiga-r-and-d-proposals">expand the existing R&amp;D tax credit</a> seems logical and sensible, and may well gain support (though I&rsquo;d be surprised if it happened this time round). However, I know that
a number of games companies have successfully claimed on the scheme, so
perhaps not that much would be gained.</p>

<p>At any rate, do I think tax breaks would be a good thing? They&rsquo;d probably be
useful to some extent. However, I don&rsquo;t believe that they&rsquo;re required to build
successful businesses and a successful industry, and I certainly don&rsquo;t believe
that having them would somehow instantly and magically safeguard the UK
industry.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6295/capturing_the_spirit_of_sesame_.php">Nathan Martz &amp; Tim Schafer on Once Upon A Monster</a></strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Frankly, I feel kind of the same way about video games right now, that we&rsquo;re
not nearly as creatively broad as we could be. We often stay very safe, and
safe in some pretty often reprehensible directions, or at least thoroughly
uncreative…. I think our medium can do many more things than that.</p></blockquote>

<p>I heart <a href="http://www.doublefine.com/">Double Fine</a> in a big way at the moment.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33140/Interview_Building_A_Brand_New_Pokemon_Universe_With_Black_And_White.php">The Importance of Silhouettes</a></strong></p>

<blockquote><p>… a key method for making sure that a Pokemon truly doesn&rsquo;t overlap with
ones that have been created in the past is that they render it in silhouette
completely black, and compare its shape with past designs. Each silhouette
must be completely identifiable as different from others.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken with people about this in the past, and it&rsquo;s one thing the games
industry generally tends not to do that well. The characters of <em><a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/games/tf2.html">Team Fortress 2</a></em> are a great example
of where it is done well, though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A post on <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/32755/InDepth_PopCaps_Possible_IPO__Analysts_Weigh_In.php">Gamasutra</a> (misleadingly captioned as being &lsquo;In-
Depth&rsquo;) discusses the possibility of PopCap going public later this year. I
have some &ldquo;issues&rdquo; with it.</p>

<blockquote><p>But the transition from a privately held developer/publisher into a public
one usually results in some changes to the corporate culture …</p></blockquote>

<p>Does it? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">Citation needed</a>, I think. I
honestly can&rsquo;t think of any comparable example. Kuju and Warthog are two
developers that went public in the UK a decade ago, but they weren&rsquo;t masters
of their own destiny. PopCap are.</p>

<p>Billy Pidgeon, senior analyst of M2 Research, then chips in:</p>

<blockquote><p>They have sort of a Disney or Nintendo thing going on in that there’s a
certain expected quality to their games. … I’d really be concerned about their
growth strategy, as it could cannibalize the elements that have made them
successful so far.</p></blockquote>

<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but Disney and Nintendo are both public companies,
aren&rsquo;t they? Both companies growth strategies are predicated on exactly that
&ldquo;expected quality&rdquo;. Why wouldn&rsquo;t that strategy work for PopCap?</p>

<p>As the article notes, PopCap has gone from $0 to $100 million in 10 years, and
is evidently making $1m per month just from <em>Bejeweled Blitz</em> and <em>Zuma Blitz</em>. It&rsquo;s strategy appears to be working.</p>

<blockquote><p>Pidgeon notes that despite the company’s growing reputation, it still takes
pains not to rush titles.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue that the &ldquo;company&rsquo;s growing reputation&rdquo; is exactly <em>why</em> it takes
pains not to rush titles.</p>

<p>Clearly, I have no idea if PopCap will go public or not &ndash; I believe they&rsquo;ve
been preparing for it for a couple of years, though (based on who joined their
board and the fact they started talking a lot more to the press). The success
or otherwise of the LinkedIn IPO will be just one factor.</p>

<p>All I&rsquo;ll add is that going public the week after <em>Toy Story</em> came out didn&rsquo;t
do <a href="http://www.pixar.com/">Pixar</a> any harm in terms of their culture and
growth strategy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>The dilemma of copycat games has long been purely an ethical one and rarely
a legal one, but perhaps we&rsquo;re speeding towards a court-ordered stance after
all these years of gentlemen&rsquo;s agreements and surly acceptance. Patents,
trademarks, code and artwork have been protected, but ideas haven&rsquo;t. Should
they be?</p></blockquote>

<p>So begins an editorial piece on
<a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-01-18-attack-of-the-clones-blog-entry">GamesIndustry.biz</a> (registration required). This is another of these
recurring issues for the industry, as <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14990">this article</a> by Colin from
<a href="http://www.denki.co.uk/">Denki</a> in 2007 neatly illustrates.</p>

<p>As Colin noted, the games industry needs to be able take ideas and build on
them, twist them around, and make something the creator considers to be one
better. That&rsquo;s exactly why you can only protect the implementation of an idea
and not the idea itself, and it&rsquo;s largely what &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; generally means.
Games aren&rsquo;t unique in relying on &ldquo;weak&rdquo; intellectual property laws in this
regard: fashion, food, music, magic tricks, and in fact, design in general all
work in this way. Without this setup, as a simple example, <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/gimmefrictionbaby.html"><em>Gimme Friction Baby</em></a> would not have
spawned <a href="http://www.orbital-game.com/"><em>Orbital</em></a>. It&rsquo;s how genres such as
&ldquo;autorunner&rdquo; come to be.</p>

<p>Where we run into real problems is in the situation of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.halfbot.com/?p=338">The Blocks Cometh and, er, The Blocks Cometh</a>&rdquo;, where someone is
selling an iPhone version of a Flash game without authorisation, using all the
original graphics and design elements. That&rsquo;s counterfeiting, a &ldquo;fraudulent
imitation of something else&rdquo;, to quote the OED. And this is where the &ldquo;strong&rdquo;
intellectual property laws of copyright, trademarks and patents come into
play. If you own copyrights and registered trademarks, you can prevent
counterfeit games trading off your success.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, so this is most definitely not legal advice, but, as an IP
owner the onus is very much on you to enforce the protection provided to you
by law (it&rsquo;s certainly not up to Apple, as GI.biz imply). If you choose not to
enforce that protection, you&rsquo;re giving tacit permission for the counterfeiter
to carry on. Worst case scenario is if you ignore some cases and try to
enforce others, you may well forfeit your right to legal protection
altogether.</p>

<p>In short, if you have something you think is worth protecting, you&rsquo;d better
figure out how you&rsquo;re going to protect it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a> has an in-depth profile with Nintendo&rsquo;s Shigeru
Miyamoto which is worth a read (<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/20/101220fa_fact_paumgarten?currentPage=all">all-in-one page here</a>).</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;d call it a positive piece, although the tone veers between
patronising and sincere. A few other things I want to comment on, in no
particular order:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fishermen have a saying, in reference to the addictive sensation of a fish
hitting your line: “The tug is the drug.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>So when can we expect the <em>Panorama</em> episode on fishing?</p>

<blockquote><p>this is called “gamification,” or, more gratingly, “funware”</p></blockquote>

<p>Seriously? &ldquo;Funware&rdquo; is <strong>more</strong> grating than that other word? Good grief.
I&rsquo;ll save my rant on this for another time.</p>

<blockquote><p>games are typically considered to be commercial products, rather than
creative works; consider the fact that game titles, unlike the names of, say,
movies or songs, appear in most newspapers and magazines, including this one,
un-italicized</p></blockquote>

<p>This bugs me, almost as much as it bugs me that the Guardian Gamesblog is in
the &lsquo;Technology&rsquo; section. However, this line clues us into why the industry is
approached this way:</p>

<blockquote><p>There aren’t very many video-game auteurs, but Miyamoto is one.</p></blockquote>

<p>and this quote from Miyamoto towards the end of the article nails it:</p>

<blockquote><p>“It’s becoming increasingly difficult to tell, from the looks and the play
of the games, who has created the software.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Most games companies take the Walt Disney approach, and create everything from
behind one brand. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. And it&rsquo;s not the oft-
lamented lack of &lsquo;auteurs&rsquo; or &lsquo;personalities&rsquo; that&rsquo;s causing the problem here
either.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a lack of <strong>distinctiveness</strong>, and not just in terms of the <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/brown-hair-and-stubble-the-new-face-of-modern-videogames-178442.phtml">central character</a>. Note that Miyamoto mentions both &lsquo;looks&rsquo; and
&lsquo;play&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The problem is that you (or, at least, I) can very rarely tell which company
is responsible for a game. Off the top of my head, if I was to do a play test
on a range of games from various creators, I think I&rsquo;d probably only be able
to identify a Valve game, a Denki game and, yes, a Nintendo game. Maybe a
PopCap game.</p>

<p>Writers, filmmakers and musicians often talk about &lsquo;finding their voice&rsquo;, the
distinctive tone or mood or themes that marks their creations out from the
hundreds of others. I think many game creators still have a way to go to find
their voice. And until games show greater diversity of theme and mood and
tone, it&rsquo;s difficult to provide a compelling argument they deserve &lsquo;creative
work&rsquo; status.</p>

<p>Anyway, asides aside, there are loads of great design tips in the article, too
many to quote here, so just go and read it. I&rsquo;ll just end with this comment
from Will Wright on Miyamoto:</p>

<blockquote><p>“He approaches the games playfully, which seems kind of obvious, but most
people don’t. And he approaches things from the players’ point of view, which
is part of his magic.”</p></blockquote>

We&#8217;re making <a href="http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2014/01/15/bodycheck-slams-into-ps-vita-later-this-year/">Bodycheck</a> for PS Vita, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/bipsgame/">Bips!</a> for Facebook, <a href="http://ludometrics.com/game/gridlock/">Gridlock</a> for OUYA and GameStick, and for iOS: <a href="http://ludometrics.com/game/dsmvwld/">Dsmvwld</a>, <a href="http://ludometrics.com/game/matching-set/">Matching Set</a>, <a href="http://ludometrics.com/game/this-way-down/">This Way Down</a> <a href="http://ludometrics.com/game/quizball/">Quizball 2012</a>. Prior to starting Ludometrics, I worked at <a href="http://www.denki.co.uk/">Denki</a>, Slam and The Games Kitchen. I&#8217;ve been making games for mobile devices since 1999 (on and off) and for everything else since forever.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s no particular topic for this blog, other than what&#8217;s on my mind. Which is usually something games-related.</p>
