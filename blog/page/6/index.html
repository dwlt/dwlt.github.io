  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you may have read, the Scottish Affairs Committee visited Scotland
yesterday to investigate the games industry. Despite some of the coverage
bordering on the <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/crisis-summit-to-save-faltering-games-industry-1.1054454?localLinksEnabled=false">hysterical</a>, I don&rsquo;t believe the Scottish games industry is in crisis. I don&rsquo;t believe there are any &ldquo;panicked&rdquo;
companies about to up sticks and move wholesale to another country.</p>

<p>The Scottish games industry is in transition.</p>

<p>Companies have been trying to move away from the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; model of the
industry, where a publisher funds the development of a game. This is a Good
Thing. Companies like Cobra and Digital Goldfish have had success on iPhone
with their own and licensed titles, Tag and Dynamo have recently received
commissions from Channel 4 for public service games.</p>

<p>As much as we&rsquo;d like it to be otherwise, not everything tried has been
successful. Denki took a different funding model for <em>Quarrel</em>, but the lack
of a distribution route for a unique experience was an insurmountable
obstacle. And Realtime Worlds took on a couple of projects of massive scope
and scale, that haven&rsquo;t panned out the way anyone would have liked
(understatement).</p>

<p>Aside from that, this year Ruffian launched <em>Crackdown 2</em>, Proper released a
<em>Final Fight</em> reboot for Capcom and the downloadable content for <em>Crackdown
2</em>, Cohort have a Move launch title, Firebrand have the best selling Wii
racing game behind <em>Mario Kart</em>, and Digital Goldfish were just included in
the Guardian&rsquo;s Tech 100 list for the second year running. Dare to be Digital
and ProtoPlay were once again huge successes. Amongst the universities,
Abertay are managing a £5m prototyping fund, Glasgow Caledonian continue to do
great research and host the Scottish Game Jam, and West of Scotland are also
conducting useful research. <a href="http://www.ready-up.net/">Ready Up</a> and <a href="http://www.square-go.com/">SquareGo</a> are terrific online games magazines. There are
a number of companies doing great work and having success in niche markets
and/or &ldquo;unglamorous&rdquo; platforms &ndash; who knows what paths they will take in the
future.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s be clear &ndash; we&rsquo;ve stumbled this year for one critical reason. We&rsquo;re
failing to make money.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of you reading that think I&rsquo;m being crass in saying that. I&rsquo;ve
paraphrased Walt Disney on this before and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll do it again in the
future:</p>

<blockquote><p>We don&rsquo;t make games to make money; we make money so we can make more games.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it; but right now we are lacking it. It&rsquo;s obviously the
key to creating a sustainable games industry, which is part of what is needed
to have a strong Scottish sector.</p>

<p>The Scottish games industry is in transition, and it&rsquo;s not something that can
be solved overnight.</p>

<p>The public sector, government and media are going to have to adjust their
expectations, though, because the new measures of success are not going to be
job creation and new company registrations. The new measures will be based on
wealth creation, rights ownership and social contribution.</p>

<p>The public sector can certainly provide support, whether through project
funding, skills development, improving the country&rsquo;s infrastructure or perhaps
even tax breaks. The mainstream press could try being cheerleaders for the
industry, though they&rsquo;ll need the industry to talk to them in order to do
that.</p>

<p>But this transition was started by the industry itself, and I believe it will
be completed by the industry itself. It won&rsquo;t happen overnight, it won&rsquo;t
happen without a few more stumbles, and it sure as hell won&rsquo;t be easy, but the
ambition is there. The belief is there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(aka what others might, on occasion, refer to as &lsquo;social games&rsquo;)</p>

<p><a href="http://gamasutra.com/view/news/29979/GDC_Europe_PopCaps_Kapalka_talks_Bejeweled_Blitz_Origins_Calls_Social_Games_A_Bit_Evil.php">Nice write-up</a> on a talk
Jason Kapalka from <a href="http://www.popcap.com/">PopCap</a> gave at GDC Europe,
centred around their experience of Bejeweled Blitz.</p>

<p>Key points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Those contests they run around the games don&rsquo;t make any difference to player numbers.</li>
<li><em>Bejeweled 2</em> just on iPhone has sold over 4,000,000 copies.</li>
<li>Resetting the high-score table (of which there is only one) once a week is better than once every two weeks.</li>
<li>Most games on Facebook are &ldquo;kind of evil&rdquo;, since they&rsquo;re trying &ldquo;any way to trick you into posting something on your wall that&rsquo;s not really even of interest to you, let alone your friends.&rdquo;</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieron_Gillen">Kieron Gillen</a>, interviewed by
<a href="http://www.blitz1up.com/articles/full_article/77">Blitz1Up</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve touched on some of that up-thread in that we see it all part of the
same fabric. The Facebook games are the same thing as the hyper-indie-art game
are the same thing as whatever costs 400 trillion pounds. It&rsquo;s all games and
we want to help encourage people to think of it as such.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds like a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/denkigames/a-game-is-a-game-is-a-game">familiar</a> <a href="http://gamasutra.com/news?story=24422">refrain</a> ;&ndash;) Anyway,
it&rsquo;s a great read, but this is the line that jumped out:</p>

<blockquote><p>The games press is very good at [telling you more about things you already
know about and are interested in] and awful at [telling you about things you
know nothing about whatsoever].</p></blockquote>

<p>This was brought home earlier this evening where it seemed like everyone was
talking about <a href="http://www.bioshockinfinite.com/">Bioshock Infinite</a>. That&rsquo;s
all fine and well if you like that kind of thing, but I don&rsquo;t like that kind
of thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve discussed with people before about how games doesn&rsquo;t seem to have it&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.pitchfork.com/">Pitchfork</a> or
<a href="http://www.stereogum.com/">Stereogum</a>, and I know games have all those
platform fragmentation issues going on, but unfortunately that&rsquo;s how most
review sites are split. Problem is I have 10 platforms for playing games in
line of sight from me right now, and I&rsquo;m totally open to suggestion on which
to play at any given time.</p>

<p>I want a site that can recommend me a game from the Xbox Indie channel in the
same breath as one for my iPhone at the same time as one for Facebook mere
moments after telling me to check out a DS game and oh you should download
this thing for your PC too.</p>

<p>Maybe it exists and I just haven&rsquo;t found it yet [NB Please tell me if you have
found such a place]. Or maybe it doesn&rsquo;t and you&rsquo;ll have to go build it for
me. Thanks in advance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following on from <a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/wonderland/2010/07/5-things-im-thinking-right-now.html">Alice</a> and
<a href="http://www.kimpallister.com/2010/07/5-things-im-thinking-right-now.html">Kim</a>
and <a href="http://danhon.com/2010/07/12/5-things-im-thinking-right-now/">Dan</a>, here
are the five things I&rsquo;m thinking right now:</p>

<ol>
<li> The funding models for games are all there; the problem comes at the other end with actually getting something out there. Clearly this is partially about the platforms and forced scarcity, but as another example there&rsquo;s no equivalent of the film festival circuit. And even if there was, the publishers are so scared of taking a risk on anything they&rsquo;re never going to find the games equivalent of <em>Blair Witch Project</em> (insert your favourite low-budget/huge-earning here).</li>
<li> To anyone who thinks that Android is somehow &ldquo;better&rdquo; for developers, you&rsquo;ve clearly blanked out/weren&rsquo;t around for the first ten years of mobile games development.</li>
<li> There&rsquo;s so much for the games industry to learn from the TV, film, radio, music or restaurant industries that it hurts my brain. If you think otherwise, I say you&rsquo;re looking in the wrong places.</li>
<li> Nintendo do so many things so, so well, that it makes the things they do badly that much more annoying.</li>
<li> To paraphrase Greg Costikyan from a GDC rant a few years back, THE WORLD IS NOT A GIANT FUNNEL DESIGNED TO POUR MONEY INTO YOUR WALLET. Get over it.</li>
</ol>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice none of those things involve food, but that&rsquo;s more of an
underlying constant thought rather than a specific one.</p>
