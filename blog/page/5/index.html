  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another week, another PopCap interview, this time <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/30520/Interview_Popcaps_Johnston_On_Plants_Vs_Zombies_Tricky_XBLA_Shift.php">with Matt Johnston</a>, senior producer on <em>Plants vs Zombies</em> for XBLA
over at Gamasutra. This one generally focuses on the value of being able to
iterate repeatedly until you get it right:</p>

<blockquote><p>We spent a lot of time just trying to get [the control system] to feel right
but I think eventually we got there</p></blockquote>

<p>(Although weirdly, the next paragraph states: &ldquo;Spending a lot of time on small
elements like this is something PopCap prides itself on&rdquo; &ndash; although I&rsquo;m not
sure I&rsquo;d classify the control system a &lsquo;small element&rsquo; of a game.)</p>

<p>They bear in mind that you have to think like a player:</p>

<blockquote><p>we sat there and spent a lot of time looking at how that double sun was
going to look and animate, trying to second guess over and over and over again
how somebody who had never played PvZ or somebody who may be confused by it,
what they would think and what they would do.</p></blockquote>

<p>They obsess on details:</p>

<blockquote><p>I feel incredibly lucky to be working for a company that values those things
and shares my need to sort of exercise my OCD and go through every little
detail.</p></blockquote>

<p>Aside from iteration, they also value knowing when to stop:</p>

<blockquote><p>To be honest, getting that working and tested would have taken another six
months … I didn’t feel like it was worth [it]. … At some point every good game
developer has to decide, ‘OK, I’m actually gonna ship this game this year.’</p></blockquote>

<p>That last paragraph reminds of me of this
<a href="http://www.danpink.com/archives/2010/01/quote-of-the-day-no-limit-for-better">quote</a> from Harrison Ford:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>You keep on going until you get it as close to being right as the time and
patience of others will allow.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>And if you read this <a href="http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/09/qa_popcaps_dave_roberts_on_zynga_iphone_and_more.html">interview</a> with the Dave Roberts, the
CEO of PopCap, you can see why they work like that:</p>

<blockquote><p>[W]e are pretty happy. We have never had to compromise anything about what
we believe in for great products … I think we are going to continue to build
some awesome value here, and people love the games. And we are going to keep
making great games.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lovely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning, Rory Cellan-Jones of the BBC
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11378852">reported</a> from Dundee about
the games industry. In the
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/rorycellanjones/2010/09/can_hi-tech_jumpstart_the_uk.html">preview</a> of his visit to Dundee (and reiterated in
his report), Cellan-Jones makes the following statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>[I] struggled to pinpoint any firm big enough to give this cluster some real
weight.</p></blockquote>

<p>He&rsquo;s right of course. But it&rsquo;s worse than that.</p>

<h3>A Geographical Aside</h3>

<p>A few years ago, we talked about the &ldquo;Scottish games industry&rdquo;. Companies
elsewhere in the UK (and abroad) referred to it as the &ldquo;Scottish games mafia&rdquo;
&mdash; whether that was tongue-in-cheek or out of annoyance (or perhaps even fear)
is open to question. Over the last few years, though, we&rsquo;ve gone from talking
about &ldquo;Scottish games&rdquo; to talking about &ldquo;Dundee games&rdquo; as companies across the
country disappeared, and now to try and remind people that things still happen
in other cities, &ldquo;Greater Glasgow games&rdquo;. I appreciate what people are trying
to do, but I dislike the locality of these terms. I find them divisive and
parochial.</p>

<p>I work in the Scottish games industry. My career in the industry has seen me
work for companies based in Livingston, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and now
Glasgow again. I want to talk about the Scottish games industry. That&rsquo;s what
matters to me. Above that, though, I believe Scotland can only support a
burgeoning technology and digital media sector across the country as a whole.
Dundee might well be the epicentre for digital media, but we need to think at
the right scale.</p>

<h3>Siren Calls</h3>

<p>One of the biggest problems we saw at <a href="http://www.denki.co.uk/">Denki</a> was on
the recruitment side. We struggled to bring in the extra people we needed and
wanted on the production side. Of course, we were trying to recruit at the
beginning of a terrible recession which didn&rsquo;t help, but it&rsquo;s also indicative
of a larger problem for the Scottish industry: we lack the siren call of the
industry&rsquo;s sexiest games.</p>

<p>It seems to me, on a purely anecdotal basis, that graduates in Scotland who
want to work in games are drawn to the bright lights and big names of the
games and companies people have heard of, so they go off to work for
<a href="http://www.ea.com/">EA</a> or <a href="http://www.ubi.com/">Ubisoft</a> on games like
<em>FIFA</em>, <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> or the latest Tom Clancy game. I don&rsquo;t have a
problem with that, it&rsquo;s good to get experience, and of course there were few
jobs in the sector going even prior to last month. But the lack of famous
games and companies becomes a problem if you want to tempt people home again,
or attract talent from elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>With the exception of Rockstar North and <em>GTA</em>, there&rsquo;s no glamour or glitter
to attract people here yet. Nothing they can work on here will give them that
kudos.</p>

<h3>Do You Know The Way To Puget Sound?</h3>

<p>Following last week&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.dwlt.net/post/1119920979/scottish-%0Agames-in-transition">post</a> about the Scottish games industry being in transition,
I&rsquo;ve been asked a couple of times about exactly what I think the Scottish
games industry is transitioning to.</p>

<p>Clearly, I can&rsquo;t say exactly what the industry will look like in a few years,
but I know what I want it to look like. And it&rsquo;s not anywhere in Canada.</p>

<p>Rather, as the subhead suggests, I&rsquo;m looking at Seattle and the surrounding
area. Not only does it have a very similar climate to Scotland, but it has an
incredible list of games companies (not to mention
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/">Microsoft</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.arena.net/">ArenaNet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bigfishgames.com/">Big Fish Games</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bungie.net/">Bungie</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.flyinglab.com/">Flying Lab</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gaspowered.com/">Gas Powered Games</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.realnetworks.com/">Real</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.runicgames.com/">Runic</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.smithandtinker.com/">Smith &amp; Tinker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.suckerpunch.com/">Sucker Punch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zombie.com/">Zombie</a></li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s just a partial list, which is pretty damned impressive, I think. It&rsquo;s a
good mix of companies that work on their own thing and work with publishers;
of companies that are independent and companies that are part of larger
organisations. And that&rsquo;s before I&rsquo;ve mentioned another pair you may have
heard of: <a href="http://www.popcap.com/">PopCap</a> and
<a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to think Scotland could have a couple of companies as strong and
world-renowned as PopCap and Valve are today. Of course, there&rsquo;s no particular
reason why it can&rsquo;t happen, but we should realise that these companies have a
head start for one big reason: Microsoft had already ensured that the Seattle
area was a draw for software developers, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>
and Real built on that. That ensured there was a large pool of talent for
other games companies to tap into, and it means that people have options. As
we&rsquo;ve seen in Scotland recently on the back of Realtime Worlds&#8217; demise, people
don&rsquo;t really have much in the way of options here.</p>

<p>Another reason for comparing Scotland to this area: the population of the
Seattle area is around 3.4 million people. Scotland&rsquo;s population is just over
5 million. We need to work at the right scale.</p>

<h3>One Step At A Time</h3>

<p>At the recent games workshop organised by Revolver, one of the speakers was
from <a href="http://www.blitzgamesstudios.com/">Blitz</a>. It struck me that far from
even producing our equivalent of PopCap or Valve, we&rsquo;ve yet to produce our
equivalent of Blitz or <a href="http://www.team17.com/">Team 17</a> or
<a href="http://www.frontier.co.uk/">Frontier</a>: successful independent development
companies who have success between developing projects for customers and
working on their own products.</p>

<p>As Cellan-Jones says, the Scottish games industry lacks weight, and it lacks
hits. We had some for a while with Realtime Worlds (Rockstar North tend to
keep themselves to themselves, in my experience). As I said last week, it&rsquo;s
not going to come overnight and it&rsquo;s definitely not going to come without a
fight.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a longer term ambition here, to create an industry that matters not
because it&rsquo;s deemed to be politically important or because it keeps a few
people employed, but to create an industry that matters because it&rsquo;s creating
products that people want to play and that they want to be a part of making.</p>

<p>Thinking at the right scale is one of the greatest problems we need to
overcome. Given the choice, I&rsquo;d prefer we didn&rsquo;t fail because we were thinking
on the small side.</p>

<p>No amount of goodwill or public policy can do what Cellan-Jones identifies in
his preview: produce a billion-dollar games company. To be clear, when I talk
about a billion-dollar games company, I don&rsquo;t expect that it would have a
billion dollars of revenue &ndash; even PopCap and Valve haven&rsquo;t hit that level
(yet). But a company capable of consistently producing hit games and that has
the wider world salivating at the prospect of its next game? Yes, please.</p>

<p>Will tax breaks help build such a company? Clearly they would, since that&rsquo;s
exactly what they&rsquo;re designed for. They won&rsquo;t will such a company into
existence, though. Only the industry itself can make that happen, and I for
one won&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s in Dundee or Aberdeen or Elgin. I&rsquo;ll just be delighted
we have the first one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you may have read, the Scottish Affairs Committee visited Scotland
yesterday to investigate the games industry. Despite some of the coverage
bordering on the <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/crisis-summit-to-save-faltering-games-industry-1.1054454?localLinksEnabled=false">hysterical</a>, I don&rsquo;t believe the Scottish games industry is in crisis. I don&rsquo;t believe there are any &ldquo;panicked&rdquo;
companies about to up sticks and move wholesale to another country.</p>

<p>The Scottish games industry is in transition.</p>

<p>Companies have been trying to move away from the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; model of the
industry, where a publisher funds the development of a game. This is a Good
Thing. Companies like Cobra and Digital Goldfish have had success on iPhone
with their own and licensed titles, Tag and Dynamo have recently received
commissions from Channel 4 for public service games.</p>

<p>As much as we&rsquo;d like it to be otherwise, not everything tried has been
successful. Denki took a different funding model for <em>Quarrel</em>, but the lack
of a distribution route for a unique experience was an insurmountable
obstacle. And Realtime Worlds took on a couple of projects of massive scope
and scale, that haven&rsquo;t panned out the way anyone would have liked
(understatement).</p>

<p>Aside from that, this year Ruffian launched <em>Crackdown 2</em>, Proper released a
<em>Final Fight</em> reboot for Capcom and the downloadable content for <em>Crackdown
2</em>, Cohort have a Move launch title, Firebrand have the best selling Wii
racing game behind <em>Mario Kart</em>, and Digital Goldfish were just included in
the Guardian&rsquo;s Tech 100 list for the second year running. Dare to be Digital
and ProtoPlay were once again huge successes. Amongst the universities,
Abertay are managing a £5m prototyping fund, Glasgow Caledonian continue to do
great research and host the Scottish Game Jam, and West of Scotland are also
conducting useful research. <a href="http://www.ready-up.net/">Ready Up</a> and <a href="http://www.square-go.com/">SquareGo</a> are terrific online games magazines. There are
a number of companies doing great work and having success in niche markets
and/or &ldquo;unglamorous&rdquo; platforms &ndash; who knows what paths they will take in the
future.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s be clear &ndash; we&rsquo;ve stumbled this year for one critical reason. We&rsquo;re
failing to make money.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of you reading that think I&rsquo;m being crass in saying that. I&rsquo;ve
paraphrased Walt Disney on this before and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll do it again in the
future:</p>

<blockquote><p>We don&rsquo;t make games to make money; we make money so we can make more games.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it; but right now we are lacking it. It&rsquo;s obviously the
key to creating a sustainable games industry, which is part of what is needed
to have a strong Scottish sector.</p>

<p>The Scottish games industry is in transition, and it&rsquo;s not something that can
be solved overnight.</p>

<p>The public sector, government and media are going to have to adjust their
expectations, though, because the new measures of success are not going to be
job creation and new company registrations. The new measures will be based on
wealth creation, rights ownership and social contribution.</p>

<p>The public sector can certainly provide support, whether through project
funding, skills development, improving the country&rsquo;s infrastructure or perhaps
even tax breaks. The mainstream press could try being cheerleaders for the
industry, though they&rsquo;ll need the industry to talk to them in order to do
that.</p>

<p>But this transition was started by the industry itself, and I believe it will
be completed by the industry itself. It won&rsquo;t happen overnight, it won&rsquo;t
happen without a few more stumbles, and it sure as hell won&rsquo;t be easy, but the
ambition is there. The belief is there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(aka what others might, on occasion, refer to as &lsquo;social games&rsquo;)</p>

<p><a href="http://gamasutra.com/view/news/29979/GDC_Europe_PopCaps_Kapalka_talks_Bejeweled_Blitz_Origins_Calls_Social_Games_A_Bit_Evil.php">Nice write-up</a> on a talk
Jason Kapalka from <a href="http://www.popcap.com/">PopCap</a> gave at GDC Europe,
centred around their experience of Bejeweled Blitz.</p>

<p>Key points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Those contests they run around the games don&rsquo;t make any difference to player numbers.</li>
<li><em>Bejeweled 2</em> just on iPhone has sold over 4,000,000 copies.</li>
<li>Resetting the high-score table (of which there is only one) once a week is better than once every two weeks.</li>
<li>Most games on Facebook are &ldquo;kind of evil&rdquo;, since they&rsquo;re trying &ldquo;any way to trick you into posting something on your wall that&rsquo;s not really even of interest to you, let alone your friends.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

  <p>There&#8217;s no particular topic for this blog, other than what&#8217;s on my mind. Which is usually something games-related.</p>
