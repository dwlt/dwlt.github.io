  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was a bit of a stramash last week regarding who <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-08-11-indies-need-to-give-up-ip-to-get-funding-rebelplay">gets to own the Intellectual Property</a> (registration required)
rights to games when someone other than the creator is paying for it. Good way
to get publicity for a new publisher, some might say.</p>

<p>As you might expect, there was a mix of outrage, agreement, indifference and
factual error in the comments that followed the article. Given that the most
common question I&rsquo;m asked in my role at the <a href="http://www.culturalenterprise.co.uk/">Cultural Enterprise Office</a> is &ldquo;Where can I get money?&rdquo;,
there were a surprising number of people prepared to turn down the chance to
get their product made.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a truism thrown around that game creators must maintain control over
their IP at all costs. It&rsquo;s certainly true that the only way you can build a
sustainable games company is to retain as many rights to as many things as
possible, but you also need a plan that actively builds that value. Simply
making a game and releasing it will technically provide you with some IP, but
if no one knows it exists is it actually valuable?</p>

<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s worth sacrificing IP to reach your ultimate destination. Pixar
never owned the IP in <em>Toy Story</em>. It was all transferred to Disney in the
funding deal for the film. Pixar did retain several royalty streams as part of
the deal (including merchandise, which for some reason no one at Disney
thought would be a big deal in a movie about toys), but Disney had full
control over when or if a sequel would happen, for example. The clue that
there was a masterplan at work is the clause that stated Pixar&rsquo;s logo would be
given equal prominence to the Disney logo in all promotional materials.</p>

<p>When Pixar filed to go public (their IPO date was the week after <em>Toy Story</em>
was due to open), they explicitly stated they wanted to build the next big
consumer facing movie brand of note. A brand that acted as a stamp of quality
and expectation in the same way as Disney, for example (the only other
example). I&rsquo;d say they certainly managed to achieve that, given that more than
five years after Disney acquired them, the name &ldquo;Pixar&rdquo; lives on above the
film name.</p>

<p>Not owning the IP to <em>Toy Story</em> didn&rsquo;t hold Pixar back, but they had a clear
understanding of why it didn&rsquo;t matter quite so much at that point. So, by all
means negotiate to keep your IP, but make sure you have a clear understanding
of what you&rsquo;re negotiating for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, the crowdfunding site that can&rsquo;t
handle non-US projects, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/10000-successful-projects">posted some stats</a> from its
first 10,000 funded projects:</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/datas/1621/successful_projects_by_category.large.jpg?1311042509" alt="" /></p>

<p>Music and Film clearly dominate, taking 61.5% of all projects between them,
but Games are way down at the other end of the scale, with just 180 projects:
1.8%.</p>

<p>Why? There&rsquo;s an <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/igda">IGDA selected project</a> page,
after all. <del>I&rsquo;ve asked <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">IndieGoGo</a> (which does
handle non-US projects) how games figured into their stats, and I&rsquo;m waiting
for them to get back to me. I&rsquo;ll update this post as and when they do
so.</del> <strong>Update:</strong> IndieGoGo will only say that games are a &ldquo;steadily
increasing percentage&rdquo; of their 30,000+ campaigns. That makes me think it&rsquo;s a
low percentage.</p>

<p>Are games creators deliberately avoiding this funding model? If so, why?
Especially given that &ldquo;lack of funding&rdquo; is one of the main reasons given for
not making something. Do they think they won&rsquo;t raise enough money? You might
not raise enough to make a big console game, but
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1019019367/urbanized-a-documentary-film-by-gary-hustwit"><em>Urbanized</em></a> (a documentary sequel to <em>Helvetica</em> and
<em>Objectified</em>) raised $118,505. Are players not interested in supporting game
makers? Do players even know who the game makers are? Are the rewards offered
by games projects powerful enough?</p>

<p>Are game makers trying but failing? I follow a fair few people on Twitter from
across film, games, music and theatre. I see lots of project promotion from
all those sectors except games, which leads me to suspect that game makers
aren&rsquo;t even trying it out.</p>

<p>Clearly, I have more questions than answers about this, but given the fuss
about this funding model in the worlds of film, music and art, I&rsquo;m curious as
to why more don&rsquo;t seem to have taken this route.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/">Letters of Note</a> is a site that collects
&ldquo;fascinating letters, postcards, telegrams, faxes, and memos.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a
<a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/06/pixar-films-dont-get-finished-they-just.html">letter</a> from Pixar director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230032/">Pete Docter</a> (<em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, <em>Up</em>) originally posted last summer, but which I&rsquo;ve seen doing the rounds again recently.</p>

<p>Mostly, people are picking up the closing line: <em>&ldquo;As John Lasseter likes to
say, our films don&rsquo;t get finished, they just get released&rdquo;</em> &ndash; a common refrain
from artists &ndash; but it&rsquo;s an earlier line that jumps out at me:</p>

<blockquote><p>It takes a lot of work (and rework, and rework and rework) to get it right.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ken Levine, of <em>Bioshock</em> fame, on <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-07-07-levine-we-need-to-be-on-the-daily-show">raising industry profile</a> (free registration required):</p>

<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not their fault. It&rsquo;s our fault. As an industry we need to think of
ourselves differently. We need to think of ourselves that way and present
ourselves that way… We have a responsibility … to educate people who don&rsquo;t
think of games. Like the people booking those [chat] shows.</p></blockquote>

<p>His point is that the games industry as a whole, isn&rsquo;t that great at raising
it&rsquo;s own profile, or the profile of those who work within it. Unless, of
course, it&rsquo;s some sort of &ldquo;video nasty&rdquo; type story (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(series)"><em>Manhunt</em></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Coffee_mod"><em>Hot Coffee</em></a>).</p>

<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about over the last week or so, triggered
by a couple of shows on BBC Scotland&rsquo;s Artworks Scotland strand. The
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0100q6v">first</a> was about Scottish bands
heading out to SXSW earlier this year. The
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012c5n2">second</a> about Scotland&rsquo;s comic book
writers and artists. Why isn&rsquo;t there a third show about Scotland&rsquo;s games
industry?</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I&rsquo;ve seen and heard plenty of evidence over the last couple of
years that school pupils and university students don&rsquo;t have a huge awareness
of where games are made in the UK, what games are made in the UK, and the fact
that there&rsquo;s an industry beyond EA, Activision, UbiSoft, Sony, Nintendo,
Microsoft or Take 2. Combine this with <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38072/LA-Noire-studio-accused-of-thankless-crunch-work">quality of life</a> and
<a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38193/Lack-of-female-devs-a-cultural-issue">workplace diversity</a> issues (never mind the <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6295/capturing_the_spirit_of_sesame_.php">lack of creative diversity</a>),
and we have ourselves a bit of an image problem. And it&rsquo;s no use talking to
ourselves about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tiga.org/">TIGA</a> have done a fantastic job of raising awareness of
the industry at a government level, and are rightly applauded for that. But I
agree with Levine&rsquo;s sentiments: it&rsquo;s up to the creators of games to get out
there and talk to the world, rather than just to ourselves. We can&rsquo;t (and
shouldn&rsquo;t) rely on a trade association to do that, we can&rsquo;t (and shouldn&rsquo;t)
rely on the media to come to us. If we don&rsquo;t talk to the world about what we
do, we have no right to complain about being misrepresented or misunderstood.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Develop <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38177/Tax-breaks-will-launch-Australia-into-the-top-3">reports</a> on Australia&rsquo;s tax relief scheme:</p>

<blockquote><p>That breakthrough scheme sets aside $1.9 billion for digital creative
companies across the country.</p></blockquote>

<p>Good for Australia, except… well, it&rsquo;s not a tax credit for &ldquo;digital creative
companies&rdquo; at all (and it&rsquo;s also not $1.9 billion). It&rsquo;s a pure R&amp;D tax
credit, according to the Australian&rsquo;s <a href="http://minister.innovation.gov.au/Carr/MediaReleases/Pages/CROSSBENCHSUPPORTMEANSNEWRDTAXCREDITWILLSTARTON1JULY.aspx">Innovation Ministry</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Gillard Labor Government’s $1.8 billion R&amp;D Tax Credit will deliver more
funding to innovative firms – including manufacturers, ICT and biotech.</p></blockquote>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, this scheme for Australia sounds almost identical to the
scheme we already have here in the UK. It&rsquo;s not just some magical pot of gold
that pours money into the bank accounts of games companies (or indeed, any
company). That&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;credit&rdquo; part in the names of these schemes means.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony Reed, CEO of the Game Developers Association of Australia,
says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our goal at the GDAA is to prepare Australia to become one of the top three
territories in the world for game development within the next five years. I
think this can be achieved.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure he does. I believe that the UK can achieve the same. What I don&rsquo;t
believe is that a tax credit scheme, however designed, is the singular basis
on which that achievement will be made.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the rumour <em>du jour</em> of course is that EA are attempting to buy PopCap for
$1 billion (according to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/popcap-games-to-be-acquired-for-1-billion/">TechCrunch</a>; VentureBeat also has
<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/06/22/popcap-sale-1-billion/">coverage</a>). I was
looking forward to PopCap going public, for a couple of reasons. First, I was
curious to see the inner workings of the company opened. Secondly, I think it
would have been a great thing for the industry in general to step eating its
own young and have a potentially hugely-powerful new pillar besides the usual
suspects.</p>

<p>Both pieces linked above have some weird bits of reporting, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>TechCrunch implies that PopCap is a &ldquo;hot gaming startup&rdquo; &ndash; whilst two paragraphs later noting that the company was founded in 2000.</li>
<li>TechCrunch claims that it would be a big deal for EA, clearly forgetting that they <a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6140935/electronic-arts-buys-jamdat">paid $680mn for Jamdat</a> in 2005.</li>
<li>VentureBeat states &ldquo;EA already tried buying a social gaming company&rdquo;. Sigh. A) PopCap games are available on every platform you can think of; B) Given that PopCap are the number 3 games company on Facebook (behind Zynga, and yes, EA) according to the same report, this puts EA into a comfortable second place.</li>
<li>A later report from TechCrunch says this deal is a &ldquo;Hail Mary pass from EA to break into mobile and social gaming&rdquo;. Umm. But they&rsquo;re #2 in social, apparently, and made $242mn from mobile in FY2011, a solid 29% of their overall revenue.</li>
</ul>


<p>EA have gone on the record as saying they&rsquo;re reinventing their business as
fast as they can to take advantage of the opportunities available in digital.
PopCap built their business in digital, and have <a href="http://blog.dwlt.net/post/5768044225/popcaps-hidden-gems">a great track record of introducing successful new titles</a>.</p>

<p>EA&rsquo;s interest in PopCap is nothing to do with getting into markets they&rsquo;re
already doing quite well in. EA&rsquo;s interest is centred around PopCap&rsquo;s ability
to continually introduce new games and to make money from them. That&rsquo;s why
they bought Chillingo rather than Rovio. The fact that PopCap have also making
interesting deals in Asia can&rsquo;t have gone unnoticed either.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also some consternation over the price, and I&rsquo;ve seen various people
saying it&rsquo;s a sign of a bubble. My take is that $1bn is basically the minimum
price required to stop PopCap going public &ndash; anything less wouldn&rsquo;t be worth
their while. Given how well they manage to grow their revenue and take
advantage of new platforms, I think it may actually be a relatively cheap deal
in the long-term. PopCap may also be thinking that the impending Groupon IPO
will actually screw up their opportunity, given all the concerns about
Groupon&rsquo;s ability to actually turn a profit.</p>

<p>From EA&rsquo;s point of view, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a great deal. I&rsquo;d (clearly) prefer that
PopCap stayed independent. PopCap themselves provided an unofficial
politician-esque response saying that &ldquo;the company was not planning to sell to
any other company for $1 billion&rdquo; &ndash; so they might be selling for a different
price, then. We shall see.</p>

<blockquote><p>From a business perspective, the willingness of consumers to take risks
means that new technologies can see profit faster here than they can
elsewhere. That encourages inventors to invent, and investors to pour money
into startups. (It’s no coincidence that the modern venture-capital industry
got its start here.) And the speed with which successful products are taken up
also allows companies to benefit from economies of scale sooner, bringing
prices down and making it easier to reach even more customers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Essentially, perhaps it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Facebook or Zynga or Dropbox were
UK companies (assuming they were reliant on UK consumers only). In other
words, the US is how to build your audience for something new.</p>

<p>Incidentally, yesterday Ian Livingstone

one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amongst all the chatter about <a href="http://www.popcap.com/">PopCap&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2011/05/popcaps-plants-vs-zombies-heads-to-china.html">likely IPO</a> later this year, and the success of games such as <em>Plants vs
Zombies</em>, <em>Bejeweled</em> and <em>Peggle</em>, one thing that&rsquo;s missing is a discussion
of what underlies PopCap&rsquo;s ability to even consider an IPO: predictability.
Games are generally considered to be a hit driven business (and by extension,
a miss-led industry), so how do you mitigate those concerns? In my mind, that
comes from an aspect of PopCap that I&rsquo;ve seen zero comment about: their
ability to manage their games and brands.</p>

<p>Everyone knows about the success of <em>Bejeweled</em>, <em>Bookworm</em>, et al, but I
haven&rsquo;t seen anyone talk about their many hidden object games. How many,
exactly? Let us count them:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 in the <em>Amazing Adventures</em> series;</li>
<li>4 in the <em>Mystery P.I</em> series;</li>
<li>2 in the <em>Escape</em> series;</li>
<li><em>Vacation Quest</em> (I&rsquo;m going to guess this is the start of a new series).</li>
</ul>


<p>For those skipping ahead, that&rsquo;s 11 in total, from their current line-up of 28
PC downloadable &lsquo;favorites&rsquo; (<a href="http://www.popcap.com/allgames.php?p=pc">source</a>).</p>

<p>Given that these games can easily sell in their tens, if not hundreds, of
thousands, and that PopCap have produced multiple editions within each
franchise, something tells me they&rsquo;re not doing too badly out of these games.</p>

<p>These may not be the games that win the plaudits and awards and press, but I&rsquo;m
pretty sure they contribute to PopCap&rsquo;s bottom line in a reasonably
predictable manner. They may well be the equivalent of EA&rsquo;s annually updated
sports games, but without the massive licensing fees attached.</p>

<p>An even more undiscussed (is that possible?) aspect of this ability is the way
they take their games to as many platforms and sales channels as possible,
including boxed product at retail. From everything I&rsquo;ve heard over the years,
PopCap&rsquo;s games do phenomenally well in stores such as Wal-Mart, Target, etc.
Bear in mind that not everyone has a broadband connection, even (especially?)
not in the US, so this is still an overlooked channel for most game creators;
one that PopCap&rsquo;s games fit perfectly. I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised to see
retail forming a large portion of PopCap&rsquo;s income.</p>

<p>PopCap&rsquo;s ability to nurture their franchises gives their games a far longer
shelf-life than is normally associated with the industry. The <em>Bejeweled</em>
series is the prime example of this, having sold more than 50 million copies
since it&rsquo;s debut in 2001, but they&rsquo;ve repeated the formula over and over.
They&rsquo;re amongst the best brand stewards in the industry, alongside
<a href="http://www.blizzard.com/">Blizzard</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo</a>,
and <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve</a>.</p>

<p>All this predictability allows PopCap to then go off and experiment with any
number of ideas. They can take an extra year to finish <em>Plants vs Zombies</em>, to
make sure it has the right level of polish. It means they can introduce new
brands, and invest enough to ensure success in the market, resulting in more
growth as they take the game to the myriad platforms that exist today.</p>

<p>To an uninformed observer like me, PopCap&rsquo;s business model seems perfectly
designed to support being a public company. Actually, scratch that; whether
public or private, they seem to have the model pretty much nailed.</p>
