  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/">Letters of Note</a> is a site that collects
&ldquo;fascinating letters, postcards, telegrams, faxes, and memos.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a
<a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/06/pixar-films-dont-get-finished-they-just.html">letter</a> from Pixar director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230032/">Pete Docter</a> (<em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, <em>Up</em>) originally posted last summer, but which I&rsquo;ve seen doing the rounds again recently.</p>

<p>Mostly, people are picking up the closing line: <em>&ldquo;As John Lasseter likes to
say, our films don&rsquo;t get finished, they just get released&rdquo;</em> &ndash; a common refrain
from artists &ndash; but it&rsquo;s an earlier line that jumps out at me:</p>

<blockquote><p>It takes a lot of work (and rework, and rework and rework) to get it right.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ken Levine, of <em>Bioshock</em> fame, on <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-07-07-levine-we-need-to-be-on-the-daily-show">raising industry profile</a> (free registration required):</p>

<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not their fault. It&rsquo;s our fault. As an industry we need to think of
ourselves differently. We need to think of ourselves that way and present
ourselves that way… We have a responsibility … to educate people who don&rsquo;t
think of games. Like the people booking those [chat] shows.</p></blockquote>

<p>His point is that the games industry as a whole, isn&rsquo;t that great at raising
it&rsquo;s own profile, or the profile of those who work within it. Unless, of
course, it&rsquo;s some sort of &ldquo;video nasty&rdquo; type story (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(series)"><em>Manhunt</em></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Coffee_mod"><em>Hot Coffee</em></a>).</p>

<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about over the last week or so, triggered
by a couple of shows on BBC Scotland&rsquo;s Artworks Scotland strand. The
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0100q6v">first</a> was about Scottish bands
heading out to SXSW earlier this year. The
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012c5n2">second</a> about Scotland&rsquo;s comic book
writers and artists. Why isn&rsquo;t there a third show about Scotland&rsquo;s games
industry?</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I&rsquo;ve seen and heard plenty of evidence over the last couple of
years that school pupils and university students don&rsquo;t have a huge awareness
of where games are made in the UK, what games are made in the UK, and the fact
that there&rsquo;s an industry beyond EA, Activision, UbiSoft, Sony, Nintendo,
Microsoft or Take 2. Combine this with <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38072/LA-Noire-studio-accused-of-thankless-crunch-work">quality of life</a> and
<a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38193/Lack-of-female-devs-a-cultural-issue">workplace diversity</a> issues (never mind the <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6295/capturing_the_spirit_of_sesame_.php">lack of creative diversity</a>),
and we have ourselves a bit of an image problem. And it&rsquo;s no use talking to
ourselves about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tiga.org/">TIGA</a> have done a fantastic job of raising awareness of
the industry at a government level, and are rightly applauded for that. But I
agree with Levine&rsquo;s sentiments: it&rsquo;s up to the creators of games to get out
there and talk to the world, rather than just to ourselves. We can&rsquo;t (and
shouldn&rsquo;t) rely on a trade association to do that, we can&rsquo;t (and shouldn&rsquo;t)
rely on the media to come to us. If we don&rsquo;t talk to the world about what we
do, we have no right to complain about being misrepresented or misunderstood.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Develop <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38177/Tax-breaks-will-launch-Australia-into-the-top-3">reports</a> on Australia&rsquo;s tax relief scheme:</p>

<blockquote><p>That breakthrough scheme sets aside $1.9 billion for digital creative
companies across the country.</p></blockquote>

<p>Good for Australia, except… well, it&rsquo;s not a tax credit for &ldquo;digital creative
companies&rdquo; at all (and it&rsquo;s also not $1.9 billion). It&rsquo;s a pure R&amp;D tax
credit, according to the Australian&rsquo;s <a href="http://minister.innovation.gov.au/Carr/MediaReleases/Pages/CROSSBENCHSUPPORTMEANSNEWRDTAXCREDITWILLSTARTON1JULY.aspx">Innovation Ministry</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Gillard Labor Government’s $1.8 billion R&amp;D Tax Credit will deliver more
funding to innovative firms – including manufacturers, ICT and biotech.</p></blockquote>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, this scheme for Australia sounds almost identical to the
scheme we already have here in the UK. It&rsquo;s not just some magical pot of gold
that pours money into the bank accounts of games companies (or indeed, any
company). That&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;credit&rdquo; part in the names of these schemes means.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony Reed, CEO of the Game Developers Association of Australia,
says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our goal at the GDAA is to prepare Australia to become one of the top three
territories in the world for game development within the next five years. I
think this can be achieved.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure he does. I believe that the UK can achieve the same. What I don&rsquo;t
believe is that a tax credit scheme, however designed, is the singular basis
on which that achievement will be made.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the rumour <em>du jour</em> of course is that EA are attempting to buy PopCap for
$1 billion (according to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/popcap-games-to-be-acquired-for-1-billion/">TechCrunch</a>; VentureBeat also has
<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/06/22/popcap-sale-1-billion/">coverage</a>). I was
looking forward to PopCap going public, for a couple of reasons. First, I was
curious to see the inner workings of the company opened. Secondly, I think it
would have been a great thing for the industry in general to step eating its
own young and have a potentially hugely-powerful new pillar besides the usual
suspects.</p>

<p>Both pieces linked above have some weird bits of reporting, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>TechCrunch implies that PopCap is a &ldquo;hot gaming startup&rdquo; &ndash; whilst two paragraphs later noting that the company was founded in 2000.</li>
<li>TechCrunch claims that it would be a big deal for EA, clearly forgetting that they <a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6140935/electronic-arts-buys-jamdat">paid $680mn for Jamdat</a> in 2005.</li>
<li>VentureBeat states &ldquo;EA already tried buying a social gaming company&rdquo;. Sigh. A) PopCap games are available on every platform you can think of; B) Given that PopCap are the number 3 games company on Facebook (behind Zynga, and yes, EA) according to the same report, this puts EA into a comfortable second place.</li>
<li>A later report from TechCrunch says this deal is a &ldquo;Hail Mary pass from EA to break into mobile and social gaming&rdquo;. Umm. But they&rsquo;re #2 in social, apparently, and made $242mn from mobile in FY2011, a solid 29% of their overall revenue.</li>
</ul>


<p>EA have gone on the record as saying they&rsquo;re reinventing their business as
fast as they can to take advantage of the opportunities available in digital.
PopCap built their business in digital, and have <a href="http://blog.dwlt.net/post/5768044225/popcaps-hidden-gems">a great track record of introducing successful new titles</a>.</p>

<p>EA&rsquo;s interest in PopCap is nothing to do with getting into markets they&rsquo;re
already doing quite well in. EA&rsquo;s interest is centred around PopCap&rsquo;s ability
to continually introduce new games and to make money from them. That&rsquo;s why
they bought Chillingo rather than Rovio. The fact that PopCap have also making
interesting deals in Asia can&rsquo;t have gone unnoticed either.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also some consternation over the price, and I&rsquo;ve seen various people
saying it&rsquo;s a sign of a bubble. My take is that $1bn is basically the minimum
price required to stop PopCap going public &ndash; anything less wouldn&rsquo;t be worth
their while. Given how well they manage to grow their revenue and take
advantage of new platforms, I think it may actually be a relatively cheap deal
in the long-term. PopCap may also be thinking that the impending Groupon IPO
will actually screw up their opportunity, given all the concerns about
Groupon&rsquo;s ability to actually turn a profit.</p>

<p>From EA&rsquo;s point of view, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a great deal. I&rsquo;d (clearly) prefer that
PopCap stayed independent. PopCap themselves provided an unofficial
politician-esque response saying that &ldquo;the company was not planning to sell to
any other company for $1 billion&rdquo; &ndash; so they might be selling for a different
price, then. We shall see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>James Surowiecki in the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/05/16/110516ta_talk_surowiecki"><em>New Yorker</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>From a business perspective, the willingness of consumers to take risks
means that new technologies can see profit faster here than they can
elsewhere. That encourages inventors to invent, and investors to pour money
into startups. (It’s no coincidence that the modern venture-capital industry
got its start here.) And the speed with which successful products are taken up
also allows companies to benefit from economies of scale sooner, bringing
prices down and making it easier to reach even more customers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Essentially, perhaps it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Facebook or Zynga or Dropbox were
UK companies (assuming they were reliant on UK consumers only). In other
words, the US is how to build your audience for something new.</p>

<p>Incidentally, yesterday Ian Livingstone
<a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-05-25-livingstone-we-write-%0Apeople-off-too-early-in-this-industry">asked</a> how we could have the next Zynga be
British. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s already been and sold itself to EA for a large amount of
money: Playfish. And related to the above, they focused on the US from day
one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amongst all the chatter about <a href="http://www.popcap.com/">PopCap&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2011/05/popcaps-plants-vs-zombies-heads-to-china.html">likely IPO</a> later this year, and the success of games such as <em>Plants vs
Zombies</em>, <em>Bejeweled</em> and <em>Peggle</em>, one thing that&rsquo;s missing is a discussion
of what underlies PopCap&rsquo;s ability to even consider an IPO: predictability.
Games are generally considered to be a hit driven business (and by extension,
a miss-led industry), so how do you mitigate those concerns? In my mind, that
comes from an aspect of PopCap that I&rsquo;ve seen zero comment about: their
ability to manage their games and brands.</p>

<p>Everyone knows about the success of <em>Bejeweled</em>, <em>Bookworm</em>, et al, but I
haven&rsquo;t seen anyone talk about their many hidden object games. How many,
exactly? Let us count them:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 in the <em>Amazing Adventures</em> series;</li>
<li>4 in the <em>Mystery P.I</em> series;</li>
<li>2 in the <em>Escape</em> series;</li>
<li><em>Vacation Quest</em> (I&rsquo;m going to guess this is the start of a new series).</li>
</ul>


<p>For those skipping ahead, that&rsquo;s 11 in total, from their current line-up of 28
PC downloadable &lsquo;favorites&rsquo; (<a href="http://www.popcap.com/allgames.php?p=pc">source</a>).</p>

<p>Given that these games can easily sell in their tens, if not hundreds, of
thousands, and that PopCap have produced multiple editions within each
franchise, something tells me they&rsquo;re not doing too badly out of these games.</p>

<p>These may not be the games that win the plaudits and awards and press, but I&rsquo;m
pretty sure they contribute to PopCap&rsquo;s bottom line in a reasonably
predictable manner. They may well be the equivalent of EA&rsquo;s annually updated
sports games, but without the massive licensing fees attached.</p>

<p>An even more undiscussed (is that possible?) aspect of this ability is the way
they take their games to as many platforms and sales channels as possible,
including boxed product at retail. From everything I&rsquo;ve heard over the years,
PopCap&rsquo;s games do phenomenally well in stores such as Wal-Mart, Target, etc.
Bear in mind that not everyone has a broadband connection, even (especially?)
not in the US, so this is still an overlooked channel for most game creators;
one that PopCap&rsquo;s games fit perfectly. I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised to see
retail forming a large portion of PopCap&rsquo;s income.</p>

<p>PopCap&rsquo;s ability to nurture their franchises gives their games a far longer
shelf-life than is normally associated with the industry. The <em>Bejeweled</em>
series is the prime example of this, having sold more than 50 million copies
since it&rsquo;s debut in 2001, but they&rsquo;ve repeated the formula over and over.
They&rsquo;re amongst the best brand stewards in the industry, alongside
<a href="http://www.blizzard.com/">Blizzard</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo</a>,
and <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve</a>.</p>

<p>All this predictability allows PopCap to then go off and experiment with any
number of ideas. They can take an extra year to finish <em>Plants vs Zombies</em>, to
make sure it has the right level of polish. It means they can introduce new
brands, and invest enough to ensure success in the market, resulting in more
growth as they take the game to the myriad platforms that exist today.</p>

<p>To an uninformed observer like me, PopCap&rsquo;s business model seems perfectly
designed to support being a public company. Actually, scratch that; whether
public or private, they seem to have the model pretty much nailed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>[This has been sitting in draft for a while. I thought I&rsquo;d post it in advance
of the budget this week.]</em></p>

<p>Way back in June 2010, the government decided to axe the proposal made by the
previous administration to provide the games industry with some sort of tax
break, saying that the proposal was &ldquo;<a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/osborne-cancels-uk-videogame-tax-relief">poorly targeted</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>On the back of that, industry reaction was along the lines of &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s really
well targeted, look it says specifically &lsquo;games&rsquo; on it&rdquo;. However, it strikes
me that &ldquo;poorly targeted&rdquo; actually means &ldquo;too narrowly targeted&rdquo;. Ontario&rsquo;s
much vaunted games tax relief isn&rsquo;t games tax relief at all; it&rsquo;s actually
digital media tax relief. This gets around the &ldquo;what is a game?&rdquo; problem by
allowing anything digital and interactive to qualify.</p>

<p>The other aspect of Ontario&rsquo;s tax relief scheme that I never see mentioned in
the UK debate is the fact that a company only qualifies for the scheme if they
spend over CA$1 million per year on employment costs. That equates to around
£625,000 in real money. If we assume that an average development company
spends around £5,000 per month per employee (and that any system in the UK
imposed an equivalent threshold), a company needs to employ a minimum of 10
staff. Given the transition of the industry towards smaller, one-project
companies, how many in the UK would actually qualify?</p>

<p>In any case, I think the call for tax breaks won&rsquo;t succeed this time around,
or at any time during this administration. For one, the Tory party really
don&rsquo;t like to target any one specific industry over any other. For another,
there&rsquo;s the administration cost to consider &ndash; any such scheme would introduce
more bureaucracy and paperwork at a time when David Cameron is ranting against
such things in a speech to his party. Ideologically, there&rsquo;s a belief that the
best route to economic growth is to enhance the fundamentals for every
business and industry, not just the select few.</p>

<p>TIGA&rsquo;s recent call to <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-03-10-mp-backs-tiga-r-and-d-proposals">expand the existing R&amp;D tax credit</a> seems logical and sensible, and may well gain support (though I&rsquo;d be surprised if it happened this time round). However, I know that
a number of games companies have successfully claimed on the scheme, so
perhaps not that much would be gained.</p>

<p>At any rate, do I think tax breaks would be a good thing? They&rsquo;d probably be
useful to some extent. However, I don&rsquo;t believe that they&rsquo;re required to build
successful businesses and a successful industry, and I certainly don&rsquo;t believe
that having them would somehow instantly and magically safeguard the UK
industry.</p>
